Weather Dashboard, Is a website where you can search any city in the world and receive the current weather for that city and also a five-day forecast for that very same city. Weather Dashboard works with an API call to openweathermap.org. After we fetch the website API, Then we turn all that data returned into a JSON string to make things easier for us to format. Once we have all the information we need, Weather Dash is just a few "for" loops and "if" statements to get everything to show up properly on the HTML. You'll notice that every city you search will be on display under the search bar in the most recent order. The list of your last ten searched cities aren't just for looks though, go ahead and click one and see what happens. Yep, that's right You can click on your last searched cities and revisit city and see if the weather has changed later that day, or even the following day. I hope you enjoy this weather app as much as I enjoyed building it. Have a Merry Christmas
